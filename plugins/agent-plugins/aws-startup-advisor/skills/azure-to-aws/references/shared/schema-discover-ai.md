# Schema — ai-workload-profile.json

> **Why this file exists.** `ai-workload-profile.json` is the artifact the entire AI track
> reads: `clarify-ai.md`, `design-ai.md`, `estimate-ai.md`, and `generate-artifacts-ai.md` all
> key off it. Without one written contract they drift on field names — the §13.3b class. This
> is the Azure port of gcp-to-aws's `schema-discover-ai.md`, kept parallel so the downstream AI
> ports stay straight; the only changes are the source-provider swaps recorded in § Azure swaps.

Produced by `discover-app-code.md` when app-code AI confidence ≥ 70%, OR — as a
minimal infrastructure-inferred profile — by `discover-iac.md` (Terraform) and/or
`discover-live.md` (live `az` capture) when the inventory is Cognitive-Services /
Azure-ML strong. All three producers have landed, and any combination may contribute
to the same run — an infrastructure-only repo (AI in Terraform and/or live tenant
state, no application code) depends on the IaC/live path; an app-code-only repo
depends on the app-code path; a run with both merges them (see § profile_source and
sources_analyzed).

## summary.ai_source — the routing key

`azure_openai | openai | anthropic | both | other`. This is the value `design-ai.md` routes on.

- `azure_openai` — Azure OpenAI SDK/deployments detected. **Routes identically to `openai`**
  (the shared OpenAI→Bedrock guide serves Azure OpenAI); the distinct label is kept for report
  wording and provenance (plan §19.9b).
- `openai` — direct OpenAI SDK (not via Azure).
- `anthropic` — Anthropic SDK.
- `both` — Azure-OpenAI/OpenAI + another provider (e.g. Anthropic).
- `other` — traditional ML only (Azure AI Vision, Document Intelligence, Speech, Language,
  Azure ML custom); routes to `design-refs/ai.md`.

Azure DROPS gcp's `gemini` value. An unrecognised `ai_source` must NOT be emitted — a value not
in this enum falls through `design-ai.md`'s routing to the traditional-ML path silently.

## models[]

One per detected model. **Field names are exact** (the §13.3b drift class):

```jsonc
{
  "model_id": "gpt-4o", // NOT model_name / name
  "service": "azure_openai", // NOT service_type / azure_service (see below)
  "detected_via": ["code"], // NOT detection_method — subset of code|terraform|billing
  "evidence": [{ "source": "code", "file": "app/llm.py", "line": 42, "pattern": "AzureOpenAI(" }],
  "capabilities_used": ["text_generation"], // NOT capabilities / features
  "usage_context": "chat completion endpoint" // NOT description / purpose
}
```

`service` example values for Azure: `azure_openai`, `azure_openai_embeddings`, `cognitive_vision`,
`cognitive_document_intelligence`, `cognitive_speech`, `cognitive_language`, `azure_ml`. May be
`[]` for `profile_source: iac_cognitive` — downstream MUST NOT assume non-empty.

## integration

```jsonc
{
  "primary_sdk": "openai", // Azure OpenAI apps use the openai SDK; also @azure/openai, azure-ai-inference
  "sdk_version": "1.x",
  "frameworks": [],
  "languages": ["python"],
  "pattern": "direct_sdk", // direct_sdk | framework | rest_api | mixed | unknown
  "gateway_type": null, // llm_router | api_gateway | voice_platform | framework | direct | null
  "capabilities_summary": { // boolean map
    "text_generation": true,
    "streaming": false,
    "function_calling": false,
    "vision": false,
    "embeddings": false,
    "batch_processing": false
  }
}
```

## profile_source and sources_analyzed — how producers combine

`metadata.profile_source` names which producer(s) contributed to this profile:
`application_code`, `iac_cognitive`, or `merged`. There is no fourth value for "live
contributed" — a live-only or IaC+live run is still `iac_cognitive` or `merged`
respectively, because `iac_cognitive` means "the profile came from infrastructure
signal, not app-code SDK detection," and that is equally true whether the
infrastructure signal was declared (Terraform) or observed (live `az`). What
distinguishes the two is `metadata.sources_analyzed.terraform` vs `.live` (see § Shape)
and each `infrastructure[]` entry's own shape (§ infrastructure[] below), not
`profile_source`.

**`sources_analyzed` fields are OR'd across every qualifying resource in the profile,
never assigned exclusively per producer.** With one IaC-sourced qualifying resource
and a different live-sourced qualifying resource in the SAME profile:
`sources_analyzed.terraform: true` (an IaC resource contributed) AND
`sources_analyzed.live: true` (a live resource also contributed) — both true
simultaneously, because both are true statements about the profile as a whole.
`summary.inferred_from_iac` follows the same OR rule: `true` if ANY qualifying
resource came from Terraform, regardless of whether other resources in the same
profile came from live `az` or app code. Only set a source flag `false` when NO
qualifying resource in the entire profile came from that source — per-resource
provenance (which specific resource came from which source) lives on that resource's
`infrastructure[]` entry, not by forcing the profile-level flag to disagree with a
resource that is plainly present.

## infrastructure[]

Two entry shapes, keyed by which producer supplied the resource — the `address` field's
presence is the discriminator, matching `discover.md`'s producer-agreement rule:

- **IaC-sourced entry:** `{ address, type, file, role?, config{}, azure_id? }`.
  `address`/`file` are the Terraform reference (`config.tf_address`/`config.tf_file`);
  `type` is the Terraform resource type when available, else the canonical Azure type.
  Examples: `azurerm_cognitive_account`, `azurerm_cognitive_deployment`,
  `azurerm_machine_learning_workspace`, `azurerm_search_service`. `azure_id` is OPTIONAL —
  present when `discover-iac.md` could reconstruct a real (non-`tf:`-placeholder) ARM id
  for the resource, per `extract-terraform.md` rule 5; absent when it could not (an
  unresolved name expression). It is the join key against a live-sourced entry (see
  Reconciliation below) — its presence does NOT make this entry a live-sourced entry,
  since `address` is still present and still the discriminator.
- **Live-sourced entry:** `{ azure_id, type, role?, config{} }` — NO `address`/`file` (there
  is no Terraform reference for a live-captured resource). `azure_id` is the full ARM
  resource id from the live capture (see `discover-live.md` § AI detection); `type` is the
  canonical `Microsoft.*` ARM type string, e.g. `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts`,
  `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/deployments`,
  `Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces`.

`[]` if neither IaC nor a live capture contributed a qualifying resource. A run with BOTH
kinds of resource (mixed IaC + live) carries both entry shapes side by side in one array.

**Reconciliation.** When an IaC-sourced entry's `azure_id` (if present) exactly matches a
live-sourced entry's `azure_id`, they describe the SAME deployed resource observed by two
producers — not two distinct resources. The assembler (see `discover-assemble.md` rule 8)
merges the pair into ONE `infrastructure[]` entry: keep the IaC-sourced shape (`address`/
`file` retained for provenance), overlay live's `config` values where they disagree (live
reflects current state), and keep whichever entry's `role` is present. An IaC-sourced
entry with no `azure_id`, or whose `azure_id` matches no live entry, stays IaC-only and
unmerged — that is a genuinely distinct resource (or one IaC could not resolve to a real
id), not a reconciliation failure. This mirrors `discover-live.md` Step 6's IaC/live merge
for the main resource inventory. See `discover.md`'s producer-agreement rule for how
`sources_analyzed`/`inferred_from_iac` behave across merged and unmerged entries.

## current_costs

Present ONLY if billing (Azure Cost Management export) OR the OpenAI usage API ran; omit
otherwise. `{ monthly_ai_spend, services_detected[], source, breakdown[], conflicting_sources[] }`,
`source ∈ billing_data | openai_usage_api | mixed`. `breakdown[]` (present only when `mixed`):
`{ provider, monthly_spend, source }`, `provider ∈ azure | openai`. Provider-aware merge: both →
SUM with `source: mixed`; same-provider overlap → usage API wins, displaced → `conflicting_sources[]`.

## detection_signals[]

`{ method, pattern, confidence, evidence }`, `method ∈ terraform | code | live_az | openai_usage_api`.

## workloads[]

ALWAYS present (`[]` if none). One per unique `(model_id, sdk_method, structured_output)`. This is
the downstream unit of work — but note **`preferences.json` `workloads[]` is the source of truth
after Clarify confirms them**, not this array.

```jsonc
{
  "workload_id": "wl_3a1f2c", // "wl_" + sha256(model_id + "|" + sdk_method + "|" + structured_flag)[:6]
  "model_id": "gpt-4o", // MUST be one of models[].model_id
  "sdk_method": "openai.chat.completions.create",
  "capability": "text_generation", // see enum below
  "capability_confidence": "high", // high | medium | low
  "structured_output": false,
  "call_sites": [{ "file": "app/llm.py", "line": 42 }] // non-empty, POSIX repo-relative
}
```

`capability` enum: `text_generation`, `structured_output`, `image_generation`, `embedding`,
`speech_to_text`, `text_to_speech`, `document_extraction`, `image_analysis`, `speech_transcription`,
`unknown`. The capability map is `references/vendored/ai/sdk-capability-map.json` (keys on SDK call
pattern, so Azure-OpenAI-via-openai-SDK is already covered). Azure Cognitive SDK methods
(`azure.ai.vision.*`, `azure.ai.formrecognizer.*`, `azure.cognitiveservices.speech.*`,
`azure.ai.textanalytics.*`) map to `image_analysis` / `document_extraction` / `speech_transcription`
and route to `design-refs/ai.md`.

## agentic_profile

Present ONLY if `is_agentic: true`; null otherwise. Provider-agnostic (framework-based).

```jsonc
{
  "is_agentic": true,
  "framework": "langgraph", // langgraph|crewai|autogen|openai_agents|strands|custom|none
  "agents": [
    {
      "agent_id": "a1",
      "file": "...",
      "line": 0,
      "model_id": "gpt-4o",
      "tools": [],
      "memory_type": "conversation_buffer",
      "role": "..."
    }
  ],
  "orchestration_pattern": "single", // single|hierarchical|swarm|graph|sequential|unknown
  "agent_count": 1,
  "tool_count": 0,
  "has_human_in_loop": false,
  "has_memory": false,
  "memory_backend": "unknown" // redis|postgres|in_memory|vector_store|unknown
}
```

`memory_type ∈ conversation_buffer|rag|none|unknown`.

## tool_manifest[]

Present ONLY if `agentic_profile` exists (`[]` if agentic but no tools). Provider-agnostic.
`{ name, file, line, transport, auth_hint, used_by_agents[] }`, `transport ∈ function|api|mcp|unknown`,
`auth_hint ∈ none|api_key|oauth|iam|unknown`. `used_by_agents ⊆ agents[].agent_id`; length =
`agentic_profile.tool_count`.

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] `summary.ai_source` is one of `azure_openai | openai | anthropic | both | other`.
- [ ] Every `models[]` entry has `model_id`, `service`, `detected_via`, `evidence`,
      `capabilities_used`, `usage_context` (exact names).
- [ ] `workloads[]` is present; every `workloads[].model_id` is in `models[].model_id`;
      `workload_id` is unique and matches the hash rule; `call_sites` non-empty.
- [ ] `agentic_profile` is present iff at least one agentic framework/signal was detected;
      `tool_manifest` present iff `agentic_profile` is.
- [ ] `current_costs` present only if billing or usage-API ran.
- [ ] No secret values anywhere (env-var/appsetting NAMES only).

## Status — build step 3 (contract), extended for live `az`

Written as the AI-track contract. `discover-app-code.md` is the application-code producer
(build step 4, now landed). `discover-iac.md`'s Cognitive-Services path and
`discover-live.md`'s AI detection are both infrastructure-signal producers (minimal
`iac_cognitive` profile) — declared and observed respectively, merged per § profile_source
and sources_analyzed when both contribute to the same run.
