# Schema — Azure discovery artifacts

Contract for the two artifacts the discover phase produces. `discover-assemble.md` is
their single creator and owns the validation checklist at the bottom.

## `azure-resource-inventory.json`

```jsonc

```

`azure_id` is the artifact's primary key and its stable address. It is preferred over
a Terraform address because it embeds the subscription and the resource group, so one
field supplies the cluster seed key, the environment scope, and uniqueness with no
derivation. Only Terraform-sourced resources need it reconstructed; Bicep, ARM, live
`az`, and RDfA all supply it.

### Typed edges

Each edge is `{ "type": "<edge type>", "to": "<azure_id>", "via": "<property>" }`.
Azure embeds full ARM resource IDs inside resource _properties_, so edges survive
every discovery source — unlike GCP, where the graph comes from Terraform reference
expressions and therefore exists only when IaC does.

This table is the **canonical** edge vocabulary. A per-dialect ref (e.g.
`extract-terraform.md` § Edges) maps its own surface syntax onto these types and must
not introduce a type that is absent here.

**Two relationships that are deliberately NOT edges:**

- **Containment.** A child resource's link to its parent needs no edge, because an ARM
  `azure_id` _contains_ its parent's as a literal prefix —
  `…/storageAccounts/assets/fileServices/default/shares/reports` yields the parent
  account by truncation, for every source and with no extraction step. `resource_group`
  inheritance (see `extract-terraform.md` step 3) covers the clustering need. Adding a
  containment edge would restate derivable information and give a second thing to keep
  in sync.
- **Observability links.** An Application Insights component's `workspace_id`, and
  diagnostic-setting targets, point at resources that are all Skip Mappings, so no
  design decision consumes the link. They belong in `config` (where the report reads
  them), not in `edges[]` — an edge implies a dependency the architecture has to
  preserve, and this one does not survive the migration at all.

### Drift records

`{ "field": "<path>", "values": [{ "source": "terraform", "value": ... }, { "source": "live", "value": ... }], "won": "live" }`

A disagreement between sources is **never** silently reconciled. Both values are kept
with their sources and the winner recorded, so the report can say "your Terraform
declares `Standard_D2s_v3`, your tenant is running `Standard_D4s_v3`". Drift the
customer did not know they had is a deliverable, not a nuisance.

## `azure_type_provenance`

**REQUIRED on every `resources[]` entry.** How the canonical type was resolved:

| Value                    | Means                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `table`                  | A row in `arm-type-canonicalization.md`. Authoritative                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `derived`                | Not listed, so derived per that file's § Deriving a type that is not listed, and the namespace **is** declared in `fast-path-services.json` → `namespace_routing` — a second artefact agreed                                |
| `derived_uncorroborated` | Derived the same way, but the namespace is **not** in that list. Still a valid entry: the cross-check is a signal, not a veto. Design routes it to a model-chosen category. Carries a `type_derived_uncorroborated` warning |
| `user_confirmed`         | A derived or unresolvable type the user confirmed (the `confirm` phase, once it lands)                                                                                                                                      |

A `derived` type is a normal, expected outcome — the table is an exception list, not a
coverage list, and 79% of its rows were restating a derivable pattern. What matters is that
the artifact says which happened, so a reviewer can tell a verified type from a resolved
one without re-deriving it.

**A `derived` type can never carry `confidence: deterministic` downstream.** Design's
`deterministic` tier requires a `direct_mappings` row AND a `fast_path_row` naming it; a
derived type reaching such a key by luck still yields `inferred`, because the type itself
was not verified.

`iac_metadata` carries the two collections that follow from this:

- **`derived_types`** — Terraform types resolved by derivation. Expected to be non-empty on
  any real repo. Report them, so a run is honest about how much of its inventory was
  derived rather than looked up.
- **`untranslated_types`** — types you **cannot name at all**. Not "no table row", and not
  "namespace unrecognised" — both of those are derived and retained. This is the residual
  case where the skill genuinely cannot say what the service is, and it is the only route to
  a halt from Discover. Expect it to be empty on almost every repo.

## live_metadata

Present only when live `az` capture contributed (the live counterpart of `iac_metadata`;
written by `phases/discover/discover-live.md`). It records live-capture provenance that has
no home on the per-resource entries:

- **`found`** — `true` when a capture manifest was read and produced ≥1 resource.
- **`captured_at`** / **`subscription`** / **`method`** — from the capture manifest
  (`resource_list` or `per_service`).
- **`capture_warnings`** — failed/skipped capture rows (a missing Reader role, a permission
  denial). These live here, NOT in `warnings[]` — that vocabulary is closed and
  IaC-parse-shaped (see § Warnings).
- **`derived_types`** — the live counterpart of `iac_metadata.derived_types`: captured ARM
  types resolved by derivation rather than a table lookup.
- **`drift`** — a run-level rollup `{ resources_live_only, resources_iac_only,
  conflicted_resources }` for reporting. The per-field disagreements themselves live on each
  resource as `resources[].drift` (see § Drift records), NOT here.

## Warnings

`warnings[]` is a **top-level array on the inventory**, always present, `[]` when
clean. Three files mandate writing to it (`discover-iac.md`, `extract-terraform.md`,
`discover.md`'s postconditions), so it is defined here, once.

```jsonc
{
  "code": "untranslated_terraform_type", // from the closed vocabulary below
  "azure_id": "<azure_id>", // when the warning is about a resource that HAS one
  "identifier": "azurerm_dev_test_lab.sandbox", // when it does not (a skipped or unresolvable thing)
  "detail": "<one sentence, customer-readable, naming the consequence>"
}
```

At least one of `azure_id` / `identifier` is required — a warning nobody can attribute
to anything is noise. `detail` states the **consequence**, not just the fact: "its
resources were not discovered" is useful, "module not found" is not.

**The vocabulary is closed.** Inventing a code makes the report's warning grouping
unstable and makes a fixture assertion on any code unreliable. Add a row here first.

| `enrichment_id_unmatched`     | (live `az` discovery only) an enrichment row's captured `id` did not match any `az resource list` fast-path entry — a resource visible to one call but not the other (e.g. a permissions or propagation gap).

Secret discarding is **not** warned about. A count of discarded fields still discloses
that they existed and roughly how many — the whole point of discarding rather than
redacting is to leave no trace.

Design writes its own `warnings[]` with a separate vocabulary; see
`phases/design/design-infra.md` § Warning codes.

## `azure-resource-clusters.json`

```jsonc
{
  "phase": "discover",
  "clusters": [
    {
      "cluster_id": "<stable slug>",
      "seed_resource_group": "<rg>", // the seed, not the answer
      "tier": "compute", // network_identity_secrets | data | compute | edge
      "members": ["<azure_id>"],
      "member_roles": {}, // azure_id -> deployment | data | configuration | network | observability | identity | idle
      "primary": "<azure_id>", // the resource the cluster is named for; see clustering/classification-rules.md
      "justification": "seed:resource_group", // REQUIRED — see below
      "edges": [], // the edge set that JUSTIFIED this grouping
      "pattern_id": "unclassified",
      "pattern_confidence": "inferred"
    }
  ],
  "unclustered": []
}
```

`edges` is not decoration. The Clarify assumption sheet needs it to explain _why_ five
resources were called one workload, and a cluster the user cannot see the reasoning
for is a cluster they cannot validate.

**`justification` exists because an unrefined cluster has a real reason that is not an
edge.** Before the split/merge refinement lands (build step 4), a cluster is one
resource group and `edges[]` is legitimately empty — the members are grouped because
they share a group, not because anything connects them. Without this field, "grouped by
the resource-group seed" and "grouped for no recorded reason" are indistinguishable,
and the phase's postcondition on the justifying edge set can only pass by not being
evaluated.

| `justification`           | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `seed:resource_group`     | the unrefined seed — every member shares one resource group, `edges[]` is empty                                                                                              |
| `edges`                   | refinement ran; `edges[]` is non-empty and is the actual justification                                                                                                       |
| `split:no_internal_edges` | carved out of a seed whose contents had no relationship between them — `edges[]` is legitimately EMPTY, because the justification is an ABSENCE and there is nothing to show |
| `merge:cross_group_edges` | merged across resource groups because a non-ambient edge crossed the boundary — `edges[]` MUST contain those crossing edges                                                  |

`justification: "edges"` or `"merge:…"` with an empty `edges[]` is a contradiction and must
fail validation. **`split:…` is exempt**, and getting this wrong is not hypothetical: an
earlier draft required a non-empty `edges[]` for every non-seed justification, which made
a correct split unrepresentable — a capability run had to mislabel nine clusters
`seed:resource_group` to pass the gate, destroying the very information the field exists
to carry.

`tier` is a fixed classification, not a computed topological depth. Fixed tiers are
what Generate's cutover sequencing actually wants, and they are stable under partial
discovery in a way a depth calculation is not.

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Every `resources[]` entry has `azure_id`, `azure_type`, `resource_group`, `subscription_id`, `source`, `config`.
- [ ] No `azure_type` value matches `azurerm_*` — translation happened during extraction.
- [ ] `azure_id` is unique across `resources[]`.
- [ ] `metadata.discovery_sources` lists only sources that contributed at least one resource.
- [ ] `metadata.clarify_fast_path` is present with a boolean `eligible` and a `reasons_ineligible[]` that is empty iff `eligible` is `true`, and every reason is one of the rule-9 input names.
- [ ] For each dialect whose files were found in the workspace, at least one resource carries that dialect as its `source`.
- [ ] No app-setting value, connection-string value, storage key, or Key Vault secret value appears anywhere.
- [ ] `warnings[]` is present (possibly empty), and every entry has a `code` from the closed vocabulary, a `detail`, and an `azure_id` or an `identifier`.
- [ ] Every `edges[]` entry's `type` appears in the § Typed edges table.
- [ ] Every inventory resource is either a cluster member or listed in `unclustered[]`.
- [ ] Every cluster has `cluster_id`, `tier`, `members`, `primary`, `member_roles`, and a `justification`.
- [ ] `primary` is a member of its own cluster, and is never a `Microsoft.Web/sites` resource.
- [ ] `member_roles` has an entry for every member except the primary.
- [ ] No resource is a member of two clusters.
- [ ] Any cluster whose `justification` is `edges` or `merge:*` has a non-empty `edges[]`. A `split:*` cluster may legitimately have an empty one.

## Status — contract in force

The shapes above are the real contract and downstream phases are written against them.
Terraform discovery writes these shapes today. Per-type `config` for Bicep and ARM,
and the reservation and utilization profiles, wait on those sources — they are not
implemented. `pattern_id`'s value set waits on `patterns.md`, which is not on disk.

`split:*` and `merge:*` are reachable as of build step 4. A cluster still carrying
`seed:resource_group` is one that survived both refinement steps untouched — a genuine
outcome for a single-workload resource group, not a sign that refinement did not run.
