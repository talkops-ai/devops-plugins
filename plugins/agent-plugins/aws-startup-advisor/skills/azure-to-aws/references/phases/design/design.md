# Phase 3: Design AWS Architecture

## Orientation

Turn the inventory, the clusters, and the confirmed preferences into
`aws-design.json`. Two product goals have to hold at once, and they pull against each
other the moment a workload-level decision disagrees with a per-resource one:

1. **Holistic** — the output describes workloads, not independent rows.
2. **Pre-determined where there is no ambiguity** — an unambiguous service is not
   routed through a rubric that could reason its way to a different answer.

The precedence order below is what reconciles them.

## Precedence order

1. **Skip Mappings** — not a target at all.
2. **Specialist gates → `Deferred`.** "We do not know" must never be overridden by
   anything below it.
3. **Eliminators** — hard technical blockers. Lambda's 15-minute ceiling is physics,
   not a preference.
4. **Direct Mappings → `deterministic`** — the pre-determined recommendations.
5. **Pattern constraint** — the holistic layer, applied to whatever is left.
6. **Six-criteria rubric** — chooses _within_ the pattern's candidate set:
   Eliminators, Operational Model, User Preference, Feature Parity, Cluster Context,
   Simplicity, applied in order, first match wins.
7. **Preferred-target substitution.**
8. **Post-selection** — right-sizing from measured utilization, then CPU
   architecture.

> **INVARIANT: a pattern may never change a `deterministic` mapping's target. It may
> only choose among rubric candidates.**

If a pattern could override a fast-path row, the `deterministic` tier would stop
meaning anything and its user-facing label ("Standard pairing") would be false. So a
genuine pattern/fast-path conflict is evidence the row does not belong in Direct
Mappings — the fix is to demote the row, never to let the pattern win.

Right-sizing is **post-selection, not a seventh criterion.** The six criteria select
a _service_ and never touch capacity; adding a seventh would break "apply in order,
first match wins". Each rubric file gets an additive `## Right-Sizing` section,
structurally parallel to `## CPU Architecture`.

## Status — build step 5 (both passes, partial)

**Pass 1 and pass 2 both run.** `knowledge/design/fast-path-services.json` carries the
disposition table; eight rubrics are on disk — `compute.md`, `database.md`,
`networking.md`, `messaging.md`, `analytics.md`, `storage.md`, `identity.md` and
`fast-path.md`. A resource routed by `index.md` to a category file that is **not** on disk
still halts rather than being improvised; `ai.md` is on disk (the AI-workload rubric);
only `licensing.md`, `gpu-hpc.md` and `patterns.md` are still to come.

**Check the filesystem, not this paragraph.** A status list in prose goes stale the moment a
file lands, and the halt decision reads from disk. If this list and `ls` disagree, `ls` is
right and this list is the bug.

Still absent: `patterns.md` and the cluster-level `data-pipeline` gate.
Clustering itself is real; only pattern recognition is outstanding, so every
cluster carries `pattern_status: "catalog_absent"`. The category rubrics named
above and the AI design route (`design-ai.md`) are on disk. Sizing tables under
`knowledge/design/` are on disk; look them up rather than treating them as future.

**A missing SIZING table is treated more softly than a missing RUBRIC file, on purpose.**
Without `appservice-eb-sizing.json` the design still names Elastic Beanstalk and states a
dev-tier instance size as a default; without `compute.md` it would have to invent the
service choice. The first degrades a number's precision, the second fabricates the answer.

The `_postconditions` encode the FINISHED contract, so some still fail by construction —
a halted design does not account for every resource. That is intended: the gate reports
the skill's gap loudly rather than letting a plausible mapping pass for a real one.

## Step: Run the phase

1. Order clusters by tier: network/identity/secrets → data → compute → edge.
2. Run each fragment whose `_trigger` holds.
3. Run `design-assemble.md`.
4. Evaluate `_postconditions`. On all-pass emit `HANDOFF_OK`; on any failure emit
   `GATE_FAIL` and stop.
