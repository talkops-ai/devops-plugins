# Clarify — Database

> **Fragment unit.** See `clarify.md` for how it is composed into the phase.
>
> **This fragment asks nothing.** It returns rows; `clarify-assemble.md` presents them.

Fires when the inventory contains a relational database, a cache, or a Cosmos account.
Category D.

**The availability row (Q-D1) is the most consequential row in the entire phase.** It
selects RDS versus Aurora, which is roughly a 2× difference on the database line, and it is
the one answer that cannot be read from the estate.

## Step 1: Extract before proposing

| Read from the inventory                                                           | Resolves                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| each flexible server's `high_availability.mode` and `zone`                        | the source's HA posture — **context for Q-D1, never the answer**               |
| `sku_name`, `storage_mb`, `version`, `backup_retention_days`                      | sizing inputs and the engine-version floor                                     |
| `Microsoft.Sql/servers/databases` `sku_name` (DTU or vCore) and `elastic_pool_id` | the Azure SQL tier; an `elastic_pool_id` routes to the specialist gate instead |
| Cosmos `kind` / `capabilities`                                                    | which API, and therefore whether Q-D5 fires at all                             |
| Cosmos `throughput` and per-container `throughput`                                | the RU/s figure Q-D5 converts                                                  |

## Step 2: The rows

### Q-D1 — Availability — the override gate's input

**Disposition:**

- **ESSENTIAL** when any source database is zone-redundant or HA-enabled. You must not
  silently downgrade resilience the customer is already paying for.
- PROPOSED otherwise. **Default:** `single-az`.

```
What availability do your databases need on AWS?

[A] Single-AZ — one instance, automated backups           (dev-tier default)
[B] Multi-AZ — synchronous standby, automatic failover, roughly 2x the cost
[C] Multi-AZ with high availability — Aurora, fastest failover
[D] Multi-region — Aurora Global Database
```

Interpret → `data.availability`:

| Answer | Write          | When `global.user_geography` is not `global`                                                                                                                                   |
| ------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [A]    | `single-az`    | —                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [B]    | `multi-az`     | —                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [C]    | `multi-az-ha`  | —                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [D]    | `multi-region` | Still write `multi-region` (the user picked [D]). Design honors it and says in the rationale that global infrastructure was requested without global users (`database.md` §1). |

Canonical `clarify-availability.md`: Catastrophic + `user_geography: "global"` is the
combination that **warrants** Aurora Global. Do not auto-upgrade [C] to `multi-region`
because geography is global — that would invent Aurora Global without the recorded
availability answer. Do not refuse [D] when geography is `single-region` / `multi-region`.

**Consequence line (PROPOSED case):** _Assuming single-AZ → the smallest defensible
database line. Multi-AZ roughly doubles it and buys automatic failover; Aurora is a
different operational model again._

**Consequence line (ESSENTIAL case — say this instead):** _Your `pg-contoso-store` is
configured `ZoneRedundant` with a standby in zone 2 today. We will not assume you want to
keep paying for that, and we will not assume you want to give it up. This one needs an
answer._

Two rules, and both matter:

1. **Do not read the source's HA setting as the answer.** It tells you what they _bought_,
   not what they _need_. Zone-redundancy is frequently a default nobody chose, and plenty
   of single-zone databases are load-bearing.
2. **When no answer is given, the default is `single-az`, explicitly not Aurora.**
   Inferring Aurora from the source's HA inflates the estimate with no visible cause, and
   the customer has no way to see which of their own inputs drove it.

Either way, if the source is zone-redundant and the answer resolves to single-AZ, Design
emits an `availability_downgrade_from_source` finding — the downgrade is a decision, so it
gets said out loud rather than buried in a sizing table.

`database.md` §1 turns this row into the RDS-versus-Aurora family selection as a
**post-rubric override**: it beats whatever the six criteria would have chosen, because
availability is never inferable from configuration.

### Q-D2 — Database cutover — **PROPOSED, deferred to Generate**

**Disposition:** PROPOSED when any relational database is present; **N/A** otherwise.
**Default:** size-derived from the extracted storage, in three branches — the boundary is
100 GiB **inclusive** on the `dump_restore` side:

| Measured sizes                                 | `default`                                 | `size_coverage` | `largest_relational_db_gib`                |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| every relational server carries `storage_mb`   | `dump_restore` at ≤ 100 GiB, `dms` above  | `"complete"`    | the measured maximum                       |
| some servers carry `storage_mb`, some do not   | the rule applied to the **measured** max  | `"partial"`     | the measured maximum                       |
| no relational server carries `storage_mb`      | `dump_restore`                            | `"unknown"`     | `null`                                     |

Record the rule and what it was applied to on the row (`default_basis`), plus the two
keys above. **Mark the row `deferred_to_generate: true`** and add `"data.db_cutover"` to
`metadata.deferred_to_generate[]` — and **only** there, never to `questions_defaulted[]`.

The unmeasured case is real, not hypothetical: `discover-live.md` lets `az resource list`
succeed and then records enrichment rows 7/8 as `failed`/`skipped` on a permission error, so
a Flexible Server arrives with no `storage_mb`; Terraform extraction omits the attribute
when the module leaves it unset. **Never invent a size** to make the rule fire. The fallback
is `dump_restore` because it is the runbook with no AWS charge — Part 4's Migration-service
line stays `$0` — so an unknown size never adds dollars nobody asked for; `dms` would.
Making the row ESSENTIAL instead would add a question the fast-path offer promises not to
ask and would break Discover's eligibility rule. The uncertainty travels on the row and
Step 3b asks for the size before recommending.

`default_basis` examples, one per branch:

- `"largest relational DB 64 GiB <= 100 GiB"`
- `"largest measured relational DB 64 GiB <= 100 GiB; mysql-contoso-reports unmeasured — rule may flip"`
- `"relational DB size unmeasured (no storage_mb on pg-contoso-store); dump_restore assumed — size is confirmed at Step 3b"`

```
How should the data move?

[A] AWS DMS with continuous replication — near-zero downtime,
    more setup, needs logical replication enabled on the source
[B] Dump and restore during a maintenance window — simpler,
    downtime proportional to database size
```

**Why this is PROPOSED-and-deferred rather than ESSENTIAL.** The two answers produce
**different runbooks**, not different numbers — DMS is a replication project with a
validation phase; a dump/restore is a scheduled outage — and that is exactly why the
question belongs where the runbook is written. Nothing before Generate consumes it except
one line of Estimate (DMS instance hours), which the default covers with a labelled
assumption. So Clarify records the size-derived default, and the question is **asked for
real at the Decision gate when the user chooses [C] Generate**
(`estimate-assemble.md` § Step 3b), before any artifact is written. The user who stops at
the decision never answers a question whose answer they would never use; the user who
generates always does.

Pair the row with the extracted size so the eventual choice is informed — a 60 GiB database
and a 6 TiB database make [B] a very different proposition — and carry that size through to
the Step 3b prompt. When `size_coverage` is not `"complete"`, Step 3b says which server(s)
went unmeasured and **asks for the size** before recommending; the row's
`largest_relational_db_gib` and `size_coverage` are not rewritten by that answer (they
record what Discover measured) — the user's figure lands in `user_stated_size_gib`.

The VM cutover question (Q-C6) stays ESSENTIAL: there is no size-derived default for MGN
versus rebuild, so it has nothing defensible to defer with.

### Q-D3 — Traffic pattern

**Disposition:** DETECTED when every source is a burstable/dev tier (the answer is
`steady`); PROPOSED otherwise. **Default:** `steady`.

```
[A] Steady — roughly constant query load                      (default)
[B] Read-heavy with peaks — would benefit from read replicas
[C] Spiky / unpredictable
```

**Consequence line:** _Assuming steady → sized from current capacity, no read replicas.
Read-heavy workloads add replicas, which adds cost but usually less than upsizing the
primary._

### Q-D4 — Storage I/O

**Disposition:** PROPOSED. **Default:** `medium`.

```
[A] Low        [B] Medium — gp3 general purpose        (default)        [C] High — needs provisioned IOPS
```

**Consequence line:** _Assuming medium I/O → gp3 storage. High-IOPS workloads need io2 or
provisioned IOPS, which is a materially different storage line._

**Storage size is never right-sized downward from utilization.** Shrinking allocated
storage is not an online operation on RDS, so a too-small guess is expensive to undo.
Carry `storage_mb` across as allocated GiB and keep the source's headroom.

### Q-D5 — Cosmos read/write split — **ESSENTIAL when it fires**

**Disposition:** ESSENTIAL when a Cosmos **Core (SQL) API** account is present; **N/A**
otherwise — the four wire-protocol APIs (Mongo, Cassandra, Gremlin, Table) are fast-path
rows and need no conversion.

```
Your Cosmos account cosmos-contoso-catalog is provisioned at 4,000 RU/s.
Converting that to DynamoDB capacity depends entirely on the read/write mix.

[A] Read-heavy — roughly 90% reads
[B] Balanced — roughly 50/50
[C] Write-heavy — roughly 90% writes
```

No default, because **the answer moves the result by multiples.** A write costs
substantially more RU than an eventually-consistent read, so the same 4,000 RU/s converts
to very different WCU/RCU depending on the mix — and only the customer knows theirs. A
silent assumption here produces a confident number that can be wrong by 5×.

Also record, as findings rather than questions:

- **Consistency does not convert.** Cosmos has five levels, DynamoDB has two. Session
  consistency in particular has no equivalent and is the commonest source setting, so the
  application may depend on read-your-writes.
- **A serverless Cosmos account has no provisioned RU/s to convert.** Recommend DynamoDB
  on-demand and say so, rather than inventing a throughput figure. An autoscale account's
  `max_throughput` is a ceiling, not a demand.

### Q-D6 — Redis module usage

**Disposition:** DETECTED when the source is `Microsoft.Cache/Redis` (plain Azure Cache
for Redis has no modules — the answer is no); PROPOSED when it is
`Microsoft.Cache/redisEnterprise`. **Default:** `false`.

**Consequence line:** _Assuming no Redis modules → ElastiCache Redis is a drop-in.
RediSearch, RedisJSON and RedisTimeSeries have no ElastiCache or MemoryDB equivalent, and
that is a feature gap rather than a sizing difference._

## Step 3: Rows returned

```jsonc
"data": {
  "availability":      { "disposition": "ESSENTIAL", "value": null, "default": null,
                         "source_ha_context": "pg-contoso-store: ZoneRedundant, standby zone 2" },
  "db_cutover":        { "disposition": "PROPOSED",  "value": null, "default": "dump_restore",
                         "deferred_to_generate": true,
                         "default_basis": "largest relational DB 64 GiB <= 100 GiB",
                         "largest_relational_db_gib": 64, "size_coverage": "complete" },
  "traffic_pattern":   { "disposition": "PROPOSED",  "value": null, "default": "steady" },
  "storage_io":        { "disposition": "PROPOSED",  "value": null, "default": "medium" },
  "cosmos_rw_split":   { "disposition": "N/A",       "value": null, "default": null },
  "redis_modules":     { "disposition": "DETECTED",  "value": false, "default": false }
}
```

`source_ha_context` is carried so the assembler can print the ESSENTIAL row's consequence
line with the actual resource named. A generic "your source may be HA" is ignorable; naming
the server is not.

## Who consumes these

| Row                             | Consumer                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `availability`                  | `database.md` §1 — the post-rubric override that selects RDS vs Aurora |
| `db_cutover`                    | Generate's migration runbook, and the DMS-versus-dump tooling choice   |
| `traffic_pattern`, `storage_io` | Estimate's instance class and storage type                             |
| `cosmos_rw_split`               | `database.md` §4's RU/s → WCU/RCU conversion                           |
| `redis_modules`                 | `database.md`'s ElastiCache eliminator                                 |

## Status — build step 5

Implemented for Postgres/MySQL Flexible Server, Single Server, Azure SQL Database, Cosmos
Core, and Redis. Managed Instance and elastic pools never reach this fragment — they are
specialist gates, and the sheet should say they were deferred rather than leaving them
silent.
