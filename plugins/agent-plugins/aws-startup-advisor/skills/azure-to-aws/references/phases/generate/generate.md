# Phase 5: Generate Migration Artifacts

## Orientation

Emit the Terraform, the scripts, the docs, and the report. This phase runs under
`_exec: { _agent: rw }` with `_interactive: false` — the work is bulky, file-only,
and self-contained, so it runs in an isolated sub-agent while the gates, the state
transition, and the `HANDOFF_OK` stay in the main window.

**The Terraform validation, the `tf-best-practices` policy gate, and the
`validation-report.json` write also stay in the main window** — the dispatched `rw`
worker emits `terraform/` only; it cannot invoke skills or run `terraform`/`python`.
This mirrors gcp-to-aws's `generate.md`, which owns validation inline in its own main
window and passes only the terraform DIR to the skill (the caller owns the report). See
§ "Step: Run the phase" step 4.

## Generate is opt-in, and the check has no mechanical teeth

The `run_mode` precondition above is an `_assert`. **CI binds `_assert` bodies but
never evaluates them** — the string is checked for being a non-empty value in the
right list, and nothing more. So the consent rule depends entirely on the interpreter
honoring the prose. A future reader should not assume this is enforced.

The DSL has no vocabulary for an opt-in phase, and inventing one for a single case
would be worse than this: the alternative is a mechanical check that the state file
carries a specific value, which the grammar does not have a check kind for.
`estimate-assemble.md` owns writing `run_mode`, and it writes
`decide_and_execute` **before** this phase loads, so a session that dies mid-Generate
resumes as an Execute run.

The `_check_phase_completed: workshop` precondition is the other half of the ordering:
the `workshop` sidebar declares `_gates: generate`, and a declined sidebar counts as
resolved.

## Sequencing

Emit in tier order — network, identity, and secrets first, then data, then compute,
then edge. That is the same tiering the clusters carry, which is why the tiering
replaced topological depth: Generate's sequencing is what the ordering is _for_.

## Status — implemented (build step: Generate)

The three artifact fragments and the assembler are wired AND their emitters are
implemented: `generate-artifacts-infra.md` emits Terraform, `generate-artifacts-docs.md`
the docs, `generate-artifacts-report.md` the stakeholder report (rendered from
`references/shared/report-decision-core.md`, full mode, validated by
`scripts/validate-migration-report.py`), and `generate-artifacts-ai.md` the AI-migration
pack when an AI design exists. The phase runs infra, AI-only (app-code-only), or both —
`_produces` and the pre/postconditions are conditional on which track exists. Read each
fragment's own `## Status`, not this line, for its emitter detail.

## Step: Run the phase

Steps 2–3 are the phase's WORK and are dispatched to the file-only `rw` worker. Step 4
and step 5 run in the MAIN window — the worker cannot invoke skills or run
`terraform`/`python`.

1. Verify the entry gate, including `run_mode`.
2. Run each fragment whose `_trigger` holds. (worker)
3. Run `generate-assemble.md`. (worker — emits `terraform/`, the docs, the report, and
   `generation-warnings.json`; it does NOT validate or write `validation-report.json`.)
4. **Validate the generated Terraform and write the validation report — MAIN WINDOW,
   after the worker returns and before `_postconditions`.** This MUST run in the main
   window because the `rw` worker cannot invoke skills or run `terraform`/`python`. This
   phase is the **caller** of the `tf-best-practices` validation protocol, exactly as
   gcp-to-aws's `generate.md` owns validation inline in its main window:
   - Invoke the `tf-best-practices` skill for the post-writing validation context, passing
     `$MIGRATION_DIR/terraform` — the DIR only (the caller owns the report, just as gcp
     passes only the terraform DIR to the skill). Treat it as a black box: run the
     fmt/init/validate stages where available, and the zero-dependency policy checker,
     which **runs regardless of the offline path** (a provider-registry outage skips
     `terraform validate` but never the policy gate).
   - Apply fix-and-retry to the reported `violations[]` sites (budget 3), then run the
     retry/skip/abort prompt.
   - WRITE the single canonical report at `$MIGRATION_DIR/validation-report.json` — the two
     segments joined by a single `/` (slash-joined). Merge the skill's policy verdict into
     THAT file as `policy_status` (+ `policy_violations` on failure), recorded independently
     of the fmt/init/validate outcome so a policy failure is never masked by
     `passed_degraded_offline`. **Never** write a separate `policy-verdict.json`, and never
     pin the skill's raw verdict path as the report.
   - An unresolved `POLICY_FAIL` the user does not `skip`/`abort` sets `status: policy_failed`
     and blocks completion (the `_postconditions` `_assert`).
5. Evaluate `_postconditions`. On all-pass emit `HANDOFF_OK` and advance to
   `complete`; on any failure emit `GATE_FAIL` and stop.
