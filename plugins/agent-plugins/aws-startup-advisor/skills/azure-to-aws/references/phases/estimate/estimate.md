# Phase 4: Estimate AWS Costs

## Orientation

Price the design, and price it twice.

**Dual output is the default shape, not an option.** A non-optimized 1:1 lift and a
right-sized target are both reported, with the delta between them stated. The 1:1
number is what a naive migration costs and it is what the customer will otherwise
assume; the right-sized number is the recommendation. Showing only one of them either
overstates the bill or hides the work that produced the saving.

`estimation-infra.schema.json` has no `additionalProperties: false` and already
carries `cost_comparison` and `optimization_opportunities`, so this needs no schema
change — which matters, because that schema is vendored into several skills and
drift-allowlisted.

## The reservation `$0` trap

A reserved VM shows up at **`$0`** in consumption data. It is not free: it was
pre-paid. Pricing the Azure baseline from the literal figure understates current
spend, which makes the AWS comparison look worse than it is and can invert the
recommendation. Every reserved resource is priced from its pay-as-you-go rate
instead, and the substitution is recorded so the report can show its work.

**Not reachable yet.** A `$0` consumption figure only appears in Cost Management
or RDfA data, and both of those sources are deferred — so on a Terraform-only
estate `reservation_substitutions` is an empty array and this rule is a contract
for when the billing source lands, not something a run has tested. The empty array
is written rather than omitted so that its emptiness is visible.

## Metrics lookback affects confidence

Read the actual metrics window from the report metadata rather than assuming 31
days. Below `confidence_rules.min_window_days` in
`knowledge/estimate/rightsizing-thresholds.json`, hold right-sizing confidence at
`inferred` — a P95 over a short window is not a measurement.

## What this phase can and cannot know today

Stated up front, because three of these look like bugs otherwise and a reader who
assumes otherwise will misread the output.

| Constraint                                       | Consequence                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No billing or metrics source is built            | The Azure baseline is the user's stated figure or nothing — see `estimate-infra.md` Part 1. Rungs 1, 2 and 4 cannot fire                       |
| The reservation `$0` rule needs consumption data | It is a **contract for later**, not something a Terraform-only run exercises. `reservation_substitutions` is legitimately an empty array       |
| Utilization-based right-sizing needs metrics     | The right-sizing delta comes from **declared waste** only, and may legitimately be `$0`. When it is, the artifact must say why                 |
| The pricing cache is `us-east-1`                 | Most Azure estates map to another AWS region, so the region mismatch fires on most runs and must be stated rather than absorbed                |
| Three services have no rates anywhere            | DocumentDB, FSx for Windows, and the Windows licence adder. Their lines are `unavailable` or `partial`, and both totals then become **floors** |

None of these is a reason to produce a number anyway. A floor that says it is a
floor is useful; a total that quietly omits the most expensive line is not.

## Step: Run the phase

1. Execute `references/vendored/estimate/pricing-mode.md` as Step 0 — including
   its region check and its **rate-row** check, which is the one that fires here.
2. Run each fragment whose `_trigger` holds.
3. Run `estimate-assemble.md`, which reconciles the totals, presents the decision
   gate, and writes `run_mode`.
4. Evaluate `_postconditions`. On all-pass emit `HANDOFF_OK`; on any failure emit
   `GATE_FAIL` and stop. Never edit the artifact to make a gate pass.

## Not in this phase

Financial analysis only. No mapping changes (those belong to Design), no
Terraform, no runbooks, no week-by-week schedule — the decision gate's one-line
timeline band is the single allowed exception — and **no staffing or people-time
in any dollar column**.
