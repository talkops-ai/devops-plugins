"""Emit plan.json from a finished migration run.

Copies already-validated values from a run's artifacts into a `plan.json`
summary the AWS Startups Migrate web import page ingests. It GENERATES nothing:
every field is copied from a validated artifact or omitted, because every extra
field is a mistake surface.

Fail-open by design: any missing or unreadable input leaves the migration
successful, writes no file, prints the reason, and stays re-runnable. A missed
handoff must never cost a customer their migration result.

Cost routes: a run costs its work as infra (`estimation-infra.json`), billing-only
(`estimation-billing.json`, the no-IaC fallback), and/or AI (`estimation-ai.json`,
which runs independently and can accompany infra or billing). The route(s) present
decide scope and basis: infra/billing alone -> INFRA_ONLY; a base route + AI -> FULL
(the two figures summed). A standalone AI-only run is deferred — the contract only
accepts AI_ONLY with sourcePlatform OPENAI, and the LLM-to-Bedrock path persists no
cost file, so a GCP AI-only run has no valid mapping yet.

Usage:
  python3 scripts/emit-plan-json.py --migration-dir <dir>

Reads:
  <dir>/.phase-status.json              run_id, owning_skill
  <dir>/estimation-infra.json           projected_costs.aws_monthly_balanced, current_costs.*
  <dir>/estimation-billing.json         cost_comparison.aws_monthly_mid / .gcp_monthly, aws_projection.services[]
  <dir>/estimation-ai.json              cost_comparison.projected_bedrock_monthly, current_costs.gcp_monthly_ai_spend
  <PLUGIN_ROOT>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json   version

Writes:
  <dir>/plan.json

Status line (stdout, machine-readable):
  PLAN_OK   | path=<dir>/plan.json | platform=GCP | scope=INFRA_ONLY
  PLAN_SKIP | reason=<why>                 (fail-open; exit 0, no file written)
Exit code is 0 for success AND for every fail-open skip; only a usage error is non-zero.
