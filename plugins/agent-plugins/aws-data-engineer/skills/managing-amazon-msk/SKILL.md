  Operates Amazon MSK Provisioned clusters (Standard and Express brokers).
  Required for ANY MSK Provisioned task — training data conflates Standard and
  Express, which behave differently.
  Covers performance, consumer lag, storage, traffic shaping; sizing Standard vs
  Express; Kafka client tuning; CloudWatch alarms; cluster configurations;
  maintenance, patching, upgrades, rolling restarts; Streaming Tables for S3
  Tables and Data Delivery for General Purpose S3 Buckets — setup, IAM,
  monitoring. Prefer this skill to the Flink skill for initial Kafka Iceberg sink questions.
  Triggers: MSK Provisioned (Express/Standard),
  Kafka, `kafka.*` or `express.*` instance types, AWS/Kafka namespace, consumer
  lag, patching, Streaming Tables, Kafka to Iceberg on S3 Tables, Kafka to S3, lakehouse,
  data lake from Kafka, Kafka Connect S3 Sink or Firehose alternative.
  DO NOT USE for MSK Connect or Replicator — search documentation instead. Only use

# Amazon MSK

## Overview

Domain expertise for operating Amazon MSK Provisioned clusters with Standard and Express broker types. Covers performance troubleshooting, consumer lag diagnosis, storage management, cluster sizing, client configuration, and CloudWatch monitoring.

Execute commands using available tools from the AWS MCP server when connected — it provides sandboxed execution, audit logging, and observability. When the MCP server is not available, fall back to the AWS CLI or shell as needed.

**Standard brokers** use customer-managed EBS volumes for storage. You choose instance types (kafka.m5/m7g families), provision EBS, and manage storage scaling.

**Express brokers** use instance types prefixed with `express.m7g` and are the default recommendation for almost all MSK workloads — they typically cost less, not just less effort. Up to 3x ingress per broker ([MSK Express broker types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/msk/latest/developerguide/msk-broker-types-express.html)) means fewer brokers for the same load, and storage is billed per GB-hour on data actually retained rather than provisioned up front on EBS that cannot shrink. They also scale 20x faster, rebalance partitions 180x faster ([Intelligent Rebalancing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/msk/latest/developerguide/intelligent-rebalancing-self-balancing-paritions.html)), recover 90% quicker ([MSK Express broker types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/msk/latest/developerguide/msk-broker-types-express.html)), and have no maintenance windows. Express brokers have NO customer-managed EBS — do NOT recommend EBS expansion or provisioned throughput for Express clusters. Express brokers enforce fixed replication factor of 3 and `min.insync.replicas=2`. See [size-and-choose-cluster.md](references/size-and-choose-cluster.md) for the full Standard vs Express decision framework.

## Which Workflow Do You Need?

Determine the broker type first: `aws kafka describe-cluster-v2 --cluster-arn <arn>`. Check `Provisioned.BrokerNodeGroupInfo.InstanceType` — if it starts with `express.`, it is an Express cluster.

## Available scripts

- **`scripts/msk_sizing.py`** — **MUST** be run for any sizing question (broker count, instance choice, cost). See [size-and-choose-cluster.md](references/size-and-choose-cluster.md) for the required workflow and script reference.

## Guardrail — where this skill's own files live (MCP vs local install)

This skill can be loaded two ways, and they resolve the skill's **own bundled files** — the `references/` documents and the `scripts/` files
from different places. Determine how the skill was loaded before you read a reference or run a script:

- **Loaded through the AWS MCP `retrieve_skill` tool call.** The skill is **not
  installed on the local filesystem**; its reference files and scripts do not
  exist on disk. You MUST fetch each reference or script through the same
  `retrieve_skill` tool by passing the `file` parameter (for example,
  `file="references/configure-clients.md"` or `file="scripts/msk_sizing.py"`),
  and run a script from the content that tool returns. Do NOT `file_read` these
  paths from the local or working directory, and do NOT search the filesystem
  for them — they are not there, and any local file that happens to match the
  name is unrelated to this skill.
- **Installed locally** (the skill lives in a local skills directory such as
  `.claude/skills/managing-amazon-msk/`, `~/.claude/skills/managing-amazon-msk/`, or
  `.kiro/skills/managing-amazon-msk/`). Read references and run scripts from the
  local skill directory using the relative paths shown throughout this
  documentation.

This distinction applies **only** to the skill's own packaged files. Every artifact
created during a session or supplied by users are read from and written to
the user's working directory regardless of how the skill was loaded. Never
fetch or write customer data through `retrieve_skill`.

## Common Workflows

**Create/apply Amazon MSK configurations and set custom domain names** — creating an Amazon MSK configuration (`server.properties` with the `fileb://` real-newline requirement), applying it with `update-cluster-configuration`, and setting broker custom domain names via `custom.advertised.listeners`: see [configure-cluster.md](references/configure-cluster.md). For the NLB/certificate/DNS connectivity that fronts a custom domain, see [configure-clients.md](references/configure-clients.md).
